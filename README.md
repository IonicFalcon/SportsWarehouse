# SportsWarehouse Project
Sports Warehouse is a retail company that would like to start selling sports equipment
online. The project will be delivered in stages, the final stage of this project is to be
delivered by the end of this semester.

This repository will act as a collection of all the files (with exception to database and documentation) to be used across the project. No file is to be removed as each file does serve a purpose, even if only for a completed section. Database files are to be stored seperated, due to the limitations of moving database files and hosting over a local network. Documentation is to be stored locally.

## Deliverable A: Website Pre-Launch
Create a one-page website showing the company logo and a message indicating they will be
selling sports equipment online soon. The page must contain a contact form that can be
filled out by the visitors of the website to ask questions
